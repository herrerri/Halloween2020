# CIS 343 - Halloween Project
## Fall 2020 - Project 3 - Ricardo Herrera-Santos

Just going to go over quickly about some of the changes I made in the program from the
specifications provided in the original document:

Weapons - Instead of giving the player multiples of each weapon type, I gave them 1 inventory
	slot for each type of weapon and added ammo for 9 random weapons worth (1 defaulted to
	hersheyskisses so they'd always have a weapon)
	
Grid - Was not able to implement a grid in time so just implemented a fairly straightforward
	house progression path where it automatically took you to the next house.
	
Observers - I think I was able to implement the observers fairly fully for the Home and NPC 
	classes, however, I ran out of time to implement it between the Home class and the Game
	class
	
Game File - Ran out of time to comment it, but I believe the code is readable enough on its own
